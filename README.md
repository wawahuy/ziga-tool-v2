# Ziga Tool V2
Collection of networked Chinese chess game tools

# Maintenance:
## 18/03/2024 - Currently, I am planning to resume its development and eagerly welcome contributions from the community.

# Issues
On December 20, 2022, Zigavn upgraded to a new version with a new cocos2D engine, causing all script hooks to malfunction.

# Notes
Shell build has not been written yet.
You should split it from the main.
